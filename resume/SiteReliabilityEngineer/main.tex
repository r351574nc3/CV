\section{Profile}
\indent A multitool of software engineering. I started software engineering over 25 years 
ago on mainframe systems. Since then, I have developed automation, user interfaces, and 
backends for video games, code generation algorithms, natural language 
processing, financials, research administration, student system administration, 
CMS, digital libraries, scientific programming, machine learning systems, embedded software, 
software deployment, storage systems, SaaS administration, and robotics.
\\\\
\indent I work primarily in software engineering and automation of cloud infrastructure
and orchestration; however, I also enjoy DevOps and Configuration Management. 
I have used the GNU/Linux operating system for over 20 years. I have run it as my 
primary desktop operating system for over 15, and have administered it for over 15 
years as well. I have built and managed firewalls with Linux as well as installed 
it on several devices that are not servers or desktops. I have also built Linux-based 
network appliances (not just firewalls). I can build both RPMs, Debian, and emerge 
packages.
